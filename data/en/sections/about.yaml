# a summary about you
summary: "In recent two years, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the world, and has changed most aspects
of human life. Healthcare AI has a mission to help humans to tackle the issues that are caused by COVID-19,
e.g., COVID-19 vaccine related prediction, COVID-19 medical imaging diagnosis. With the development of
the epidemic, the virus keeps mutating, and meanwhile the related research is also evolving. As a result,
more and more understanding, observation, and policy are emerging. All of these factors bring new
challenges and opportunities to scientific research, including Healthcare AI.
The goal of this workshop is to bring together perspectives from multiple disciplines (e.g., Healthcare AI,
Machine Learning, Medical Image ML, Bioinformatics, Genomics, Epidemiology, Public Health, Health Policy,
Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Cognitive Science) to highlight major open questions and to identify
collaboration opportunities to address outstanding challenges in the domain of COVID-19 related Healthcare
AI.
